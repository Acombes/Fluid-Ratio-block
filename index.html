            bit long. I know I tend to be rather long from times to times, so please don't hesitate to stop me if
            you can't take it anymore. You can even slap me in the face ! No, you wouldn't dare doing that, would
            you ? You're too nice for that. I'm not. I would slap your ugly face over and over if you came to annoy me
            with your relentless talking. Without any kind of shame whatsoever. Yeah, that's pretty harsh, I know, but
            sometimes you just have to do something, do you see what I mean ?
